# Datasets

Pima Indians Diabetes is main data set that used in that workshop.

You can find the data set for __the final project__ in [this section](final-project.md).

## Pima Indians Diabetes

### Objective

Using Machine Learning methods predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements. 

### Content

The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, `Outcome`. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
